# Health & Fitness Dashboard (Excel Project – 2024–25)

## 🔍 Overview:

This project presents a health and fitness tracking dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel, using a custom-created dataset of 50 entries across 13 columns. It includes key wellness metrics such as steps, calories, sleep hours, water intake, mood, and heart rate. The dashboard delivers data-driven insights through pivot tables and interactive visualizations.
## 💡 Real-World Insights Explored:

Using dashboard elements like:

* Heart Rate Comparison by Workout Type
* Average Heart Rate by Mood
* Yearly Water Intake Overview
* Total Steps Taken Each Year
* Mood Count vs Sleep Duration
* Calories Burned by Mood Type

...this project answers critical health tracking questions such as:

* Which workouts elevate heart rate the most?
* How do different moods affect heart performance?
* Is water intake consistent across years?
* Are step counts improving yearly?
* How does sleep duration vary with mood?
* Which moods lead to more calorie burn?

## 📊 Key Work Done:

* Created a custom health dataset with calculated fields (e.g., calories/min, water/hr sleep).
* Applied data cleaning, formatting, and reverse chronological sorting.
* Built pivot tables for KPIs like average steps, total distance, active minutes, sleep, and heart rate.
* Designed an interactive dashboard* using bar charts, line graphs, and donut charts.
* Structured sheets: Main DataSet, KPI Analysis, Analysis, and Dashboard.

## 🛠 Tools Used:

* Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Formatting)
* Data Visualization & KPI Metrics
* Analytical Reporting
